# Interactive Food Truck Ordering System

This project involves creating an interactive ordering system based on a food truck menu using Python. The system allows customers to place an order, store their selections, and print a receipt with the total price of the items ordered.

## Background

The goal of this project is to apply the skills learned so far in Python by designing an interactive food ordering system. This includes storing orders, validating user input, and calculating the total price of the customer's selection.
